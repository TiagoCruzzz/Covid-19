# Covid-19 Data Analysis and Dashboard Project
Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Dashboard Project repository! In this project I have utilized SQL to query a COVID-19 dataset and created an informative dashboard using POWER BI to visualize the relevant information. This README will guide you through the project's objectives, the dataset used, and how to access and interact with the dashboard. 
#
### Project Objectives:
The main goals of this project were:
1. Data Retrieval: Retrieve and preprocess COVID-19 data from a reliable source.
2. SQL Queries: Use SQL to perform various queries and transformations on the dataset.
3. Data Analysis: Extract meaningful insights and summary statistics from the data.
4. Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize and present the analyzed data.
#
### Dataset: 
I used a publicly available COVID-19 dataset for this project. This dataset contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, between others. The dataset is continually updated to provide the most recent information.

### SQL Queries:
I used SQL (MySQL) to perform a variety of queries on the dataset, including but not limited to:
- Aggregating data and making calculations to obtain the mortality and incidence rate by country, continent and global values.
- Querys to help me to understand the data.
- Analyzing trends over time.
- Comparing statistics between countries and continents.
#
### Power BI Dashboard:
The core of this project is the Power BI dashboard, which offers an interactive and visually appealing way to explore the Covid-19 data. With the inclusion of buttons is possible to change between pages and other options. 
The dashboard includes:
- Overview: A summary of Global Covid-19 statistics.
- Geographical and comparative visualizations: Maps, charts, and value cards to visualize and compare the data between continents and between countries.

##### How to access the dashboard? 
To access and interact with the dashboard follow this steps:
- Open Power BI: You need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer or phone and an account. 
- Open the dashboard: https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=0439d618-2055-4537-bd37-fda41606a59d&autoAuth=true&ctid=c1025aae-98b9-4021-b4b6-c201214b884e
- Interact with the dashboard: Once the dashboard is open, you can explore the data and interact with the visualizations.
